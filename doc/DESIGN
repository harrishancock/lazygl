A single render pass is a call that results in data being written to a
framebuffer or a transform feedback buffer. A render pass that writes to a
transform feedback buffer involves:


draw indirect buffer | metadata from gl*Draw*
vertex array object {
    [element array buffer]
    vertex attributes (in VBOs)
}
shader program {
    vertex shader
    [tessellation control shader]
    [tessellation eval shader]
    [geometry shader]
}
transform feedback {
    vertex buffer objects
}

A render pass that writes to a framebuffer involves:

draw indirect buffer | metadata from gl*Draw*
vertex array object {
    [element array buffer]
    vertex attributes (in VBOs)
}
shader program {
    vertex shader
    [tessellation control shader]
    [tessellation eval shader]
    [geometry shader]
    fragment shader
}
framebuffer
